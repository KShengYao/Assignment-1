# Assignment-1
The Overview of my project is about aiming the target audiance that is people who love japanese gerne or people who are interested in rock music and thats why i choose a band that is related to this gerne that is Mrs Green Apple Mrs. GREEN APPLE to give a brief about the band that is us a three member rock band from tokyo that made its major debut in 2015 with EMI records. My website will include the differnt contents that is News, live, profile, Discography,video and a shop. News content will include the different release dates thier new albums and collaborations that is happening with in them. Live content will include the upcoming live that is happening or in the future. Profile will include the three current members that is still in the group and the timeline of years. Discography content which will include the different albums that they release during the years of being a band. Video content will show their music videos and lastly the shop will include their merchandise.

# Design Process

As a user type, i want to preform an action where the user is able to:

-have a good brief about all the contents that will be happening inside the home website and able to see the different features too that i will explain later on.

-When the user is on the news page they would see at least 8 different news that is happening and when the user press one of the news it will dropdown format where the user is able to read whats going on and the details about it.

-for the live content it will have the same desgin as the news as it will show the different news about the LIVE and able to read the details from

-The design for Discography where the user is able to move from page to page to view the different album that is sang by a group or its by one of the memebrs only and also have a brief of the different sounds inside a album.

-The desgin for video content is where the user is able to press on the video which will lead to the youtube and description to be changed and the user can lsiten it from the website itself and dont have to bother to go to an extend link.

-Lastly for the store it will include merchandise where the user is able to see and select which items that they want and able to procced to the checkout box like the a normal checkout page.

so that I can achieve a goal for a user point of view.
